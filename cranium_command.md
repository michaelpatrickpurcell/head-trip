# Cranium Command

__General Knowledge__: All right, pinhead, listen up. Your job is to pilot this craft through a typical day's maneuvers without overstressing it. Remember, use your head, don't lose your head. I got my eye on you, Fuzzy. Screw up this mission and you'll be piloting a chicken 'til your retirement day. Got that?!

_Static, then General Knowledge disappears._

__Buzzy__: Uh, yes sir. Guess I better get this show on the road. Okay crew, report in. Left Brain, Right Brain! Come in, please.

__Hypothalamus__ (in a bored, Ben Stein-like monotone): Yes, Captain? Did you call?

__Buzzy__: Uh, no. I ... guess I just pressed the wrong button.

__Hypothalamus__: It figures. No one ever wants to talk to me.

__Buzzy__: Who are you, anyway?

__Hypothalamus__: I'm only the hypothalamus. I only monitor all the automatic functions of the body. All the things you don't need to worry about. I'm used to being taken for granted. Blink, blink, breathe, breathe, day in, day out. Never a "Thank you," never a "Job well done."

__Buzzy__: Gee, I'm sorry. I had no idea. Hey, wait a minute. What're all these things?

__Hypothalamus__: Dreams, sir. You're in the sleep mode. You should've had this in class.

__Buzzy__: Hmmm. Looks pretty simple ...

_The alarm goes off to a radio station set to loud rock music, and Bobby opens his eyes. We can see his room._

__Buzzy__: Whoa! Whoa! What's going on?! What's happening?! Whoa! Oh, the alarm clock. Eyes, find the clock! Arms, hit it, hit it!

__Bobby shuts off the alarm.__

__Buzzy__: Ahhh. Well, I guess we're awake now, huh? Good morning, guys.

__Left Brain__ (always businesslike and efficient): Morning, Captain. Left Brain reporting for duty, sir. Logic circuits working at full capacity. Let's have a safe and sane day, shall we?

__Buzzy__: Roger, Left Brain.

__Right Brain__ (a groovy Flower Child): Right brain here, Buzz! Free association and creativity banks fully charged.

__Buzzy__: Roger, dude.

__Left Ventricle__ (the body-building Franz from "Saturday Night Live"): Heart reporting, Captain. Left ventricle ...

__Right Ventricle__ (the body-building Hans from "Saturday Night Live"): Right Ventricle!

__Both Left and Right Ventricles__: We are on ... and pumping!

__Adrenaline__ (perpetually frazzled and hyper): Adrenal Gland reporting, Captain. Ready to freak out at any second!

__Buzzy__: Not now, please.

__Stomach__ (imagine Norm from "Cheers" at The Hungry Heifer Restaurant): Stomach reporting, Captain. Runnin' on empty down here. Suppose you could toss down some of those cold pizza crusts from last night? You could just, you know -

__Bobby's Mother__: Bobby, aren't you up yet? The bus'll be here any second.

__Bobby__: Okay, Mom, I'm up.

__Buzzy__: Okay, guys, we're running a little late. Legs, swing over forty-five degrees and extend peds. Head for the door. Walk vector ten.

__Left Brain__: Going to school stark naked, are we? Puh-lease!

_We can see Bobby's reflection in the mirror, from the waist up, and he's not wearing any clothes._

__Buzzy__: Whoa! Quick! Let's find some clothes. There's gotta be something in here. Ah, good, pants. Uh, shirt's still okay, it's only been worn a couple of days. Shoes. All right, we're outta here.

__Left Brain__: Aren't we forgetting some ... functions?

__Buzzy__: Uh ... Elimination, give me a reading!

__Elimination__: Uh, bladder reading at 9.9, sir.

__Buzzy__: We can hold it.

__Elimination__: (Gets a horrified look and mouths "No! No!")

__Buzzy__: Full speed ahead!

__Left Brain__: I can see you're going to put us all under a bit of a strain today.

__Stomach__: Captain, I know we're in a hurry, but this puppy's starting to growl down here, ya know what I mean?

__Buzzy__: I hear you, Stomach. Looks like we've got breakfast dead ahead. Let's chow down.

_Bobby's mother has prepared a huge breakfast for him._

__Right Brain__: Guys! Let's go for the dessert!

_A horn honks outside._

__Bobby's Sister__: Hey, Smarty-Pants, the bus is here.

__Stomach__: Could've sworn I heard something about breakfast.

_The bus honks twice more._

__Adrenaline__: The bus!!

__Buzzy__: Run for it!

_Bobby proceeds to run like crazy toward the bus, dodging traffic._

__Man__: Whoa! Bobby, would you watch where you're going?

__Another Man__: Hey kid! Get off my car!

__Buzzy__: It's getting away! Quick! Take a shortcut.

__Left Brain__: Planning an alternate route to school, sir. Memory indicates the presence of a small, rabid poodle -

__Poodle__: Bark! Bark! Bark!

__Buzzy__: Whoa! Watch out! Back up!

__Adrenaline__: I see it! Step on it! Step on it!

__Buzzy__: Quick! Cut through here.

_Bobby detours through a neighbor's house, passing a lady in her laundry room._

__Right Ventricle__: Heart reporting, Captain, we are pumping!

__Left Ventricle__: Ja, but we're really low on energy.

__Right Ventricle__: What are you going to do about it?

__Buzzy__: Stomach, we need fuel! Do you read?

__Stomach__: No can do, Captain. Remember that breakfast we didn't have?

__Hypothalamus__: Blood sugar is falling.

__Left Brain__: You have exactly two seconds to get to class.

_Bobby is rushing through the school building._

__Buzzy__: Cut to the right! Turn! (Bobby enters the Chemistry lab just as the bell rings, and Buzzy breathes a sigh of relief). There's our desk.

__Chemistry Teacher__: Okay, my little ... monsters. Let's create.

__Annie__: Excuse me. Looks like we're gonna be lab partners.

__Right Brain__: Yes!

__Left Ventricle__: Heart reporting, Captain. We have just skipped a beat.

__Right Ventricle__: Ja, what is going on up there?

__Buzzy__: She's beautiful!

__Annie__: Um, I'm new here. My name's Annie. What's yours?

__Buzzy__: Uh ... say something.

__Bobby__: Uh ... B-b-beautiful. I mean, Bobby.

__Sensory Report__: Contact. 6.5, Captain.

__Annie__: Okay, Bobby. I'll measure; you mix.

__Left Brain__: Careful, careful. Some of these compounds are not entirely stable.

__Right Brain__: I feel like an unstable compound whenever we look at her. This must be chemistry.

__Left Brain__: Concentrate! This could be dangerous.

__Buzzy__: Just imagine ...

__Song__: Hey Venus, oh Venus, make my wish come true ...

__Annie__: Bobby, watch out!

__Buzzy__: Whoa! Hands, get outta there! Feet! Stomp it! Stomp it! Put it out!

__Left Brain__: See? You put us in an explosive situation!

__Adrenaline__: I've never had to work this hard in my life.

__Right Ventricle__: Ja, what a loser Captain we have.

__Left Ventricle__: Yeah, you're a pathetic girly-man.

__Right Ventricle__: You're a girly-man, loser, and pathetic.

__Stomach__: Say now, Captain, I'd be willing to call it even if you could just toss a little bit of food into the old dumpster. Whaddya say?

_By this time, Bobby has left Chemistry class, and it is now lunchtime._

__Buzzy__: Okay, guys, this time we'll eat. I promise. (sees Annie in the cafeteria line) Wow, look. There she is.

__Annie__: Oh, hi.

_Two bullies walk up to Annie._

__Rico__: Hey look, Chad, it's the new girl.

__Chad__: She needs some company, huh, Rico?

_They begin messing up the food on Annie's tray._

__Annie__: Come on, you guys ...

__Buzzy__: We've gotta help her!

__Right Brain__: We'll rescue her! We'll swing in on a vine, and take her to a desert island!

__Left Brain__: Nonsense. We'll simply explain to these ruffians the lasting negative ramifications of their delinquent behavioral tendencies.

__Buzzy__: Okay, you take the helm, Left Brain.

__Left Brain__: All right, Bobby, address them.

__Bobby__: Ahem! Come now, gentlemen. I'm sure I needn't point out the negative impact in both social and academic dimensions of your Neanderthal tactics.

_The bullies turn their attention toward Bobby, grab him, and Adrenaline begins freaking out._

__Bobby__: I should point out that this will reflect very poorly on your citizenship record, and it'll look bad when you're not studying at the college of your choice!

_The bullies throw Bobby into a trash can._

__Right Brain__: You've got to give me a chance for revenge!

__Buzzy__: Okay, Right Brain, go!

_Bobby grabs something from the trash can and thrusts it into Chad's face. The food fight rapidly escalates._

__Right Brain__: Ramming speed!

__Buzzy__: Look out! Yeah, duck! Duck!

__Adrenaline__: FOOD FIGHT!!

__Hypothalamus__: I suppose you'll be wanting reflex dodge maneuvers, sensors on hypervigilence, and endorphin pain suppressors on maximum.

__Right Brain__: Give me some action!

__Stomach__: Hey Buzz! As long as you're tossing all that food around, why don't you toss some down here, eh?

__Buzzy__: All right, Stomach, here you go, a burger with everything on it.

__Stomach__: (screams) Alleluliah! (garbled)

__Sensory Report__: (garbled)

__Buzzy__: Watch it! Milk cartons launching, sector 4-D!

__Right Brain__: That's whole milk, too! These guys are serious!

__Stomach__: Who took the bite out of it?

__Sensory Report__: Reload! Reload!

__Buzzy__: Incoming lasagna at five o'clock. Dive! Dive! (garbled) Going down!

_Static, and General Knowledge appears onscreen._

__General Knowledge__: What the devil is going on, Drunky? Your job is to protect this body from unnecessary stress, not send it into a coma!

__Buzzy__: Well, the Left Brain wanted - but then the Adrenal Gland said - and the -

__General Knowledge__: You can't just listen to every fool thing that comes into your head. That's why there's chaos in this body. Make decisions! Get this crew working together! You're just begging to pilot this chicken, aren't you, boy? (holds up a chicken)

__Buzzy__: Y-yes, sir. I - I mean no, sir!

__General Knowledge__: I'm warning you, Skunky!

__Chicken__: Cluck!

_Static, and General Knowledge disappears._

__Buzzy__: I've gotta get my act together here. Okay, I'll do better. I'll use my head. He'll be proud of me. All right. Hands, wipe the eyes, please.

_Bobby wipes the food off his eyes, and sees a teacher standing in front of him, covered with food._

__Teacher__: Well, young man, perhaps a trip to the Principal's office will straighten you out.

__Buzzy__: Lose audio, I get the idea.

__Right Brain__: We're gonna get the salt mines, I tell ya! The curtain! The big house! Maybe even prison!

__Principal__ (to the two bullies): Six weeks detention. Out!

_Bobby passes the bullies on his way into the Principal's office. They glare at him._

__Right Brain__: Six weeks?! Oh no. It'll be an eternity.

__Stomach__: How 'bout a last meal? Uh, it's kinda traditional.

_Bobby is now in Principal Hardcase's office._

__Principal__: Right. And what's your side of this?

__Buzzy__: Uh, stall for time. Shuffle feet. Uh, wring hands.

__Left Brain__: We'll probably be put on suspension for this. We can kiss Harvard good-bye. No job. No upwardly mobile lifestyle. I hope you're proud of yourself, young man. You obviously have no need for logic whatsoever. Thank you so much, and good night.

__Lungs__: Lungs reporting, sir! We're hyperventilating! Batten down the bronchial tubes!

__Left Brain__: I recommend a brown paper bag.

__Hypothalamus__: CO2 is dropping fast.

__Right Brain__: Oh, I'm feelin' really light-headed, man.

__Left Ventricle__: Listen to us now and believe us later. If we were 30 years older, we'd be attacking you right now.

__Right Ventricle__: Ja, if we live that long.

__Adrenaline__: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!

__Stomach__: Sorry, Captain. We can't take much more of this. I'm gonna have to send some back up (begins to toss food back up).

__Buzzy__: No, don't! Seal all exits! Seal all exits!

_Static, and General Knowledge appears onsceen._

__General Knowledge__: What in blazes are you up to now?!

__Buzzy__: I might as well say good-bye now, sir. They're gonna burn as at the stake and send our ashes to Siberia.

__General Knowledge__: Nonsense, Pinky. You're just worrying yourself sick. Real stress or imagined stress, it doesn't matter beans to your body crew. They can't tell the difference, only you can. Take charge, lunkhead! Be calm, cool, collected, serene, balanced, centered, and relaxed. Like ME!!

_Static, and General Knowledge disappears._

__Buzzy__: Now hear this! Quiet!! Look, guys, this isn't the end of the world, okay? Now let's cooperate for once. Left Brain?

__Left Brain__: Yes sir?

__Buzzy__: Give me the bottom line.

__Left Brain__: Logic.

__Buzzy__: Right Brain?

__Right Brain__: Do what you really feel.

__Buzzy__: I've got a solution that covers both. We're going to tell the truth.

__Bobby__: I'm sorry, Mr. Hardcase. When I saw those guys bugging Annie, I - I guess I just lost my head.

__Principal__: I think we can be a little lenient here. Why don't you just help the janitor clean up the cafeteria after school?

__Bobby__: Really? Boy, thank you, sir. Thanks a lot.

__Principal__: Right, right, right. Get outta here. Go on.

__Left Brain__: Well done, Buzzy: Wonderfully logical.

__Right Brain__: It felt glorious. It was beautiful.

__Buzzy__: Yeah, we're starting to get the hang of it now. What with a little teamwork, we'll become invincible.

__Sensory Report__: Warning! Warning! You've been tapped on the shoulder. Warning! Warning!

__Adrenaline__: It's a ghost!!!!

__Buzzy__: Adrenaline, would you chill out?! You're getting everybody all worked up. Just keep cool, guys, and stand by for instructions. Come full about.

_Bobby turns around and sees Annie._

__Annie__: Hi Bobby.

__Bobby__: (sigh of relief)

__Annie__: Look, um, I just wanted to thank you for helping me out with those guys who were hassling me.

__Buzzy__: No sweat.

__Bobby__: No sweat.

__Annie__: You were like ... pretty neat.

__Buzzy__: Golly, she likes us.

__Right Ventricle__: Captain, we are having a sudden burst of energy.

__Left Ventricle__: Ja, we are feeling young at heart.

__Stomach__: Hey, who ordered the butterflies?

__Right Brain__: Ooh man, she's cute. Just look at the way her eyes glisten in that fluorescent tube lighting.

__Left Brain__: Oh, let's not start daydreaming again. Let's do something constructive.

__Buzzy__: Tell you what. We'll ask her out.

__Left Brain__: Bold move, sir.

__Bobby__: Maybe we could go out sometime after school, like maybe to the mall or something?

__Annie__: Okay. That'd be great. Thanks again, Bobby(smiles at Bobby, kisses him, and walks away with glee).

_Wild applause and cheers from the crew members, and General Knowledge appears onscreen._

__General Knowledge__: Outstanding, recruit! Look after your body crew, and they'll serve you well. Congratulations. You are now a full-fledged member of the Cranium Command! I'm proud of you, boy!

__Buzzy__: Thanks, General! I never could've done it without everyone's help. This is one first rate crew.

__Hypothalamus__: No need to thank me, sir. I don't do it for the glory. It's just my function.

__General Knowledge__: Well, Chicken, what're we gonna do about a pilot for you?

__Chicken__: Cluck! I don't need one. I'm going into politics.

__General Knowledge__: Heh. Politics. So long, Buzzy! Keep up the good work!

_Static, and General Knowledge disappears._

__Right Brain__: Let's hear it for Captain Buzzy!

__All__: Hip, hip, hooray!

__Buzzy__: Now remember, gang. If you get stressed out, just call on your general knowledge, balance your body crew, and get your cranium under command. Use your head, don't lose your head. You need it! You'll be flying in no time ... as a member of the Cranium Command! Bye!

__Hypothalamus__: On behalf of the Cranium Commandos, Metropolitan Life, and the Walt Disney Company, thank you for volunteering for Cranium Command. Please gather your belongings and exit the command center through the doors on your left. ... Madame, you forgot your child. Oh. That's your husband. I'm very sorry. I mean that. ​
