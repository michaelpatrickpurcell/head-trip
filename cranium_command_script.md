# Cranium Command Script

General Knowledge: All right, pinhead, listen up. Your job is to pilot this craft through a typical day's maneuvers without overstressing it. Remember, use your head, don't lose your head. I got my eye on you, Fuzzy. Screw up this mission and you'll be piloting a chicken 'til your retirement day. Got that?!

static, then General Knowledge disappears

Buzzy: Uh, yes sir. Guess I better get this show on the road. Okay crew, report in. Left Brain, Right Brain! Come in, please.

Hypothalamus: <in a bored, Ben Stein-like monotone> Yes, Captain? Did you call?

Buzzy: Uh, no. I ... guess I just pressed the wrong button.

Hypothalamus: It figures. No one ever wants to talk to me.

Buzzy: Who are you, anyway?

Hypothalamus: I'm only the hypothalamus. I only monitor all the automatic functions of the body. All the things you don't need to worry about. I'm used to being taken for granted. Blink, blink, breathe, breathe, day in, day out. Never a "Thank you," never a "Job well done."

Buzzy: Gee, I'm sorry. I had no idea. Hey, wait a minute. What're all these things?

Hypothalamus: Dreams, sir. You're in the sleep mode. You should've had this in class.

Buzzy: Hmmm. Looks pretty simple ...

The alarm goes off to a radio station set to loud rock music, and Bobby opens his eyes. We can see his room.

Buzzy: Whoa! Whoa! What's going on?! What's happening?! Whoa! Oh, the alarm clock. Eyes, find the clock! Arms, hit it, hit it!

Bobby shuts off the alarm.

Buzzy: <sigh of relief> Ahhh. Well, I guess we're awake now, huh? Good morning, guys.

Left Brain: <always businesslike and efficient> Morning, Captain. Left Brain reporting for duty, sir. Logic circuits working at full capacity. Let's have a safe and sane day, shall we?

Buzzy: Roger, Left Brain.

Right Brain: <a groovy Flower Child> Right brain here, Buzz! Free association and creativity banks fully charged.

Buzzy: Roger, dude.

Left Ventricle: <the body-building Franz from "Saturday Night Live"> Heart reporting, Captain. Left ventricle ...

Right Ventricle: <and his partner Hans> Right Ventricle!

Both Left and Right Ventricles: We are on ... and pumping!

Adrenaline: <perpetually frazzled and hyper> Adrenal Gland reporting, Captain. Ready to freak out at any second!

Buzzy: Not now, please.

Stomach: <imagine Norm from "Cheers" at The Hungry Heifer Restaurant> Stomach reporting, Captain. Runnin' on empty down here. Suppose you could toss down some of those cold pizza crusts from last night? You could just, you know -

Bobby's Mother: Bobby, aren't you up yet? The bus'll be here any second.

Bobby: Okay, Mom, I'm up.

Buzzy: Okay, guys, we're running a little late. Legs, swing over forty-five degrees and extend peds. Head for the door. Walk vector ten.

Left Brain: Going to school stark naked, are we? Puh-lease!

We can see Bobby's reflection in the mirror, from the waist up, and he's not wearing any clothes.

Buzzy: Whoa! Quick! Let's find some clothes. There's gotta be something in here. Ah, good, pants. Uh, shirt's still okay, it's only been worn a couple of days. Shoes. All right, we're outta here.

Left Brain: Aren't we forgetting some ... functions?

Buzzy: Uh ... Elimination, give me a reading!

Elimination: Uh, bladder reading at 9.9, sir.

Buzzy: We can hold it.

Elimination: <Gets a horrified look and mouths "No! No!">

Buzzy: Full speed ahead!

Left Brain: I can see you're going to put us all under a bit of a strain today.

Stomach: Captain, I know we're in a hurry, but this puppy's starting to growl down here, ya know what I mean?

Buzzy: I hear you, Stomach. Looks like we've got breakfast dead ahead. Let's chow down.

Bobby's mother has prepared a huge breakfast for him.

Right Brain: Guys! Let's go for the dessert!

A horn is heard outside.

Bobby's Sister: Hey, Smarty-Pants, the bus is here.

Stomach: Could've sworn I heard something about breakfast.

The bus honks twice more.

Adrenaline: The bus!!

Buzzy: Run for it!

Bobby proceeds to run like crazy toward the bus, dodging traffic.

Man: Whoa! Bobby, would you watch where you're going?

Another Man: Hey kid! Get off my car!

Buzzy: It's getting away! Quick! Take a shortcut.

Left Brain: Planning an alternate route to school, sir. Memory indicates the presence of a small, rabid poodle -

Poodle: Bark! Bark! Bark!

Buzzy: Whoa! Watch out! Back up!

Adrenaline: I see it! Step on it! Step on it!

Buzzy: Quick! Cut through here.

Bobby detours through a neighbor's house, passing a lady in her laundry room.

Right Ventricle: Heart reporting, Captain, we are pumping!

Left Ventricle: Ja, but we're really low on energy.

Right Ventricle: What are you going to do about it?

Buzzy: Stomach, we need fuel! Do you read?

Stomach: No can do, Captain. Remember that breakfast we didn't have?

Hypothalamus: Blood sugar is falling.

Left Brain: You have exactly two seconds to get to class.

Bobby is rushing through the school building.

Buzzy: Cut to the right! Turn! <Bobby enters the Chemistry lab just as the bell rings, and Buzzy breathes a sigh of relief.> There's our desk.

Chemistry Teacher: Okay, my little ... monsters. Let's create.

Annie: Excuse me. Looks like we're gonna be lab partners.

Right Brain: Yes!

Left Ventricle: Heart reporting, Captain. We have just skipped a beat.

Right Ventricle: Ja, what is going on up there?

Buzzy: She's beautiful!

Annie: Um, I'm new here. My name's Annie. What's yours?

Buzzy: Uh ... say something.

Bobby: Uh ... B-b-beautiful. I mean, Bobby.

Sensory Report: Contact. 6.5, Captain.

Annie: Okay, Bobby. I'll measure; you mix. Left Brain: Careful, careful. Some of these compounds are not entirely stable.

Right Brain: I feel like an unstable compound whenever we look at her. This must be chemistry.

Left Brain: Concentrate! This could be dangerous.

Buzzy: Just imagine ...

Song: Hey Venus, oh Venus, make my wish come true ...

Annie: Bobby, watch out!

Buzzy: Whoa! Hands, get outta there! Feet! Stomp it! Stomp it! Put it out!

Left Brain: See? You put us in an explosive situation!

Adrenaline: I've never had to work this hard in my life.

Right Ventricle: Ja, what a loser Captain we have.

Left Ventricle: Yeah, you're a pathetic girly-man.

Right Ventricle: You're a girly-man, loser, and pathetic.

Stomach: Say now, Captain, I'd be willing to call it even if you could just toss a little bit of food into the old dumpster. Whaddya say?

By this time, Bobby has left Chemistry class, and it is now lunchtime.

Buzzy: Okay, guys, this time we'll eat. I promise. <sees Annie in the cafeteria line> Wow, look. There she is.
Annie: Oh, hi.

Two bullies walk up to Annie.

Rico: Hey look, Chad, it's the new girl.

Chad: She needs some company, huh, Rico?

They begin messing up the food on Annie's tray.

Annie: Come on, you guys ...

Buzzy: We've gotta help her!

Right Brain: We'll rescue her! We'll swing in on a vine, and take her to a desert island!

Left Brain: Nonsense. We'll simply explain to these ruffians the lasting negative ramifications of their delinquent behavioral tendencies.

Buzzy: Okay, you take the helm, Left Brain.

Left Brain: All right, Bobby, address them.

Bobby: Ahem! Come now, gentlemen. I'm sure I needn't point out the negative impact in both social and academic dimensions of your Neanderthal tactics.

The bullies turn their attention toward Bobby, grab him, and Adrenaline begins freaking out.

Bobby: I should point out that this will reflect very poorly on your citizenship record, and it'll look bad when you're not studying at the college of your choice!

The bullies throw Bobby into a trash can.

Right Brain: You've got to give me a chance for revenge!

Buzzy: Okay, Right Brain, go!

Bobby grabs something from the trash can and thrusts it into Chad's face. The food fight rapidly escalates.

Right Brain: Ramming speed!

Buzzy: Look out! Yeah, duck! Duck!

Adrenaline: FOOD FIGHT!!

Hypothalamus: I suppose you'll be wanting reflex dodge maneuvers, sensors on hypervigilence, and endorphin pain suppressors on maximum.

Right Brain: Give me some action!

Stomach: Hey Buzz! As long as you're tossing all that food around, why don't you toss some down here, eh?

Buzzy: All right, Stomach, here you go, a burger with everything on it.

Stomach: <screams> Alleluliah! <garbled>

Sensory Report: <garbled>

Buzzy: Watch it! Milk cartons launching, sector 4-D!

Right Brain: That's whole milk, too! These guys are serious!

Stomach: Who took the bite out of it?

Sensory Report: Reload! Reload!

Buzzy: Incoming lasagna at five o'clock. Dive! Dive! <garbled> Going down!
static, and General Knowledge appears onscreen

General Knowledge: What the devil is going on, Drunky? Your job is to protect this body from unnecessary stress, not send it into a coma!

Buzzy: Well, the Left Brain wanted - but then the Adrenal Gland said - and the -

General Knowledge: You can't just listen to every fool thing that comes into your head. That's why there's chaos in this body. Make decisions! Get this crew working together! You're just begging to pilot this chicken, aren't you, boy? <holds up a chicken>

Buzzy: Y-yes, sir. I - I mean no, sir!

General Knowledge: I'm warning you, Skunky!

Chicken: Cluck!

static, and General Knowledge disappears

Buzzy: I've gotta get my act together here. Okay, I'll do better. I'll use my head. He'll be proud of me. All right. Hands, wipe the eyes, please.

Bobby wipes the food off his eyes, and sees a teacher standing in front of him, covered with food.

Teacher: Well, young man, perhaps a trip to the Principal's office will straighten you out.

Buzzy: Lose audio, I get the idea.

Right Brain: We're gonna get the salt mines, I tell ya! The curtain! The big house! Maybe even prison!

Principal's voice: <to the two bullies> Six weeks detention. Out!

Bobby passes the bullies on his way into the Principal's office. They glare at him.

Right Brain: Six weeks?! Oh no. It'll be an eternity.

Stomach: How 'bout a last meal? Uh, it's kinda traditional.

Bobby is now in Principal Hardcase's office.

Principal: Right. And what's your side of this?

Buzzy: Uh, stall for time. Shuffle feet. Uh, wring hands.

Left Brain: We'll probably be put on suspension for this. We can kiss Harvard good-bye. No job. No upwardly mobile lifestyle. I hope you're proud of yourself, young man. You obviously have no need for logic whatsoever. Thank you so much, and good night.

Lungs: Lungs reporting, sir! We're hyperventilating! Batten down the bronchial tubes!

Left Brain: I recommend a brown paper bag.

Hypothalamus: CO2 is dropping fast.

Right Brain: Oh, I'm feelin' really light-headed, man.

Left Ventricle: Listen to us now and believe us later. If we were 30 years older, we'd be attacking you right now.

Right Ventricle: Ja, if we live that long.

Adrenaline: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!

Stomach: Sorry, Captain. We can't take much more of this. I'm gonna have to send some back up. <begins to toss food back up>

Buzzy: No, don't! Seal all exits! Seal all exits!

static, and General Knowledge appears onsceen

General Knowledge: What in blazes are you up to now?!

Buzzy: I might as well say good-bye now, sir. They're gonna burn as at the stake and send our ashes to Siberia.

General Knowledge: Nonsense, Pinky. You're just worrying yourself sick. Real stress or imagined stress, it doesn't matter beans to your body crew. They can't tell the difference, only you can. Take charge, lunkhead! Be calm, cool, collected, serene, balanced, centered, and relaxed. Like ME!!

static, and General Knowledge disappears

Buzzy: Now hear this! Quiet!! Look, guys, this isn't the end of the world, okay? Now let's cooperate for once. Left Brain?

Left Brain: Yes sir?

Buzzy: Give me the bottom line.

Left Brain: Run.

Buzzy: Right Brain?

Right Brain: Do what you really feel.

Buzzy: I've got a solution that covers both. We're going to tell the truth.

Bobby: I'm sorry, Mr. Hardcase. When I saw those guys bugging Annie, I - I guess I just lost my head.

Principal: I think we can be a little lenient here. Why don't you just help the janitor clean up the cafeteria after school?

Bobby: Really? Boy, thank you, sir. Thanks a lot.

Principal: Right, right, right. Get outta here. Go on.

Left Brain: Well done, Buzzy: Wonderfully logical.

Right Brain: It felt <garbled>. It was beautiful.

Buzzy: Yeah, we're starting to get the hang of it now. What with a little teamwork, we'll become invincible.

Sensory Report: Warning! Warning! You've been tapped on the shoulder. Warning! Warning!

Adrenaline: It's a ghost!!!!

Buzzy: Adrenaline, would you chill out?! You're getting everybody all worked up. Just keep cool, guys, and stand by for instructions. Come full about.

Bobby turns around and sees Annie.

Annie: Hi Bobby.

Bobby: <sigh of relief>

Annie: Look, um, I just wanted to thank you for helping me out with those guys who were hassling me.

Buzzy: No sweat.

Bobby: No sweat.

Annie: You were like ... pretty neat.

Buzzy: Golly, she likes us.

Right Ventricle: Captain, we are having a sudden burst of energy.

Left Ventricle: Ja, we are feeling young at heart.

Stomach: Hey, who ordered the butterflies?

Right Brain: Ooh man, she's cute. Just look at the way her eyes glisten in that fluorescent tube lighting.

Left Brain: Oh, let's not start daydreaming again. Let's do something constructive.

Buzzy: Tell you what. We'll ask her out.

Left Brain: Bold move, sir.

Bobby: Maybe we could go out sometime after school, like maybe to the mall or something?

Annie: Okay. That'd be great. Thanks again, Bobby. <smiles at Bobby, kisses him, and walks away with glee>

wild applause and cheers from the crew members, and General Knowledge appears onscreen

General Knowledge: Outstanding, recruit! Look after your body crew, and they'll serve you well. Congratulations. You are now a full-fledged member of the Cranium Command! I'm proud of you, boy!

Buzzy: Thanks, General! I never could've done it without everyone's help. This is one first rate crew.

Hypothalamus: No need to thank me, sir. I don't do it for the glory. It's just my function.

General Knowledge: Well, Chicken, what're we gonna do about a pilot for you?

Chicken: Cluck! I don't need one. I'm going into politics.

General Knowledge: Heh. Politics. So long, Buzzy! Keep up the good work!

static, and General Knowledge disappears

Right Brain: Let's hear it for Captain Buzzy!

All: Hip, hip, hooray!

Buzzy: Now remember, gang. If you get stressed out, just call on your general knowledge, balance your body crew, and get your cranium under command. Use your head, don't lose your head. You need it! You'll be flying in no time ... as a member of the Cranium Command! Bye!

Hypothalamus: On behalf of the Cranium Commandos, Metropolitan Life, and the Walt Disney Company, thank you for volunteering for Cranium Command. Please gather your belongings and exit the command center through the doors on your left. ... Madame, you forgot your child. Oh. That's your husband. I'm very sorry. I mean that. ​
