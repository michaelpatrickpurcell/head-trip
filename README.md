# Head Trip
A game for four or five players that is played with two standard decks of playing cards. There are two ways to play Head Trip.

The first way to play is as a four-player competitive card game. During the game, each player will portray an aspect of the personality of a teenage boy named Bobby. Only one aspect can control Bobby's actions at any given time, so the the players will have to compete for control as he faces a series of challenges.

The second way to play is as a five-player semi-cooperative roleplaying game. During the game, four of the players will play as in the four-player competitive card game version described above.  The fifth player, however, will play as the Headmaster. The Headmaster's job is to provide narrative context for what happens in the game by working with the other players to tell a story about Bobby's experiences.
