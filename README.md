# Head Trip
A tabletop roleplaying game designed to emulate the experience of the (now defunct) theme park attraction Cranium Command.


## Inspirations
  - __Cranium Command__: Cranium Command was presented in the Wonders of Life pavilion at Walt Disney World Resort's EPCOT theme park from 19 October 1989 until 01 January 2007.
  - __Herman's Head__: Herman's Head was an American television show that aired on the Fox network from 08 September 1991 until 21 April 1994.
  - __Inside Out__: Inside Out was a film created by Pixar which was released in 2015.

## Characters
The game's story focuses on the exploits of a young boy named Bobby as he tries to make his way through a typical day in the life of a teenage boy.

Each player assumes the role of an anthropomorphised representation of an aspect of Bobby's personality. There are four such aspects:
  - __The Animal__: represents Bobby's basic drives.
  - __The Angel__: represents Bobby's sensitivity.
  - __The Genius__: represents Bobby's intellect.
  - __The Student__: represents Bobby's memory and ability to learn from past experiences.

## Checks
When Bobby attempts to do something and the outcome is uncertain, the players make a check to determine if Bobby is successful.

### Skills
Every check tests one of three skills:
  - __Physical__: The Animal gets advantage on any physical check.
  - __Mental__: The Genius gets advantage on any mental check.
  - __Social__: The Angel get advantage on any social check.

The Student does not get advantage on any kind of check!

### Rewards
The outcome of every check has both narrative and mechanical consequences. As with skills, there are three kinds of rewards:
  - __Physical__:
  - __Mental__:
  - __Social__:

## Score
Each Aspect is scored on their performance during the game.
  - __The Animal__: The number of physical rewards that Bobby receives.
  - __The Angel__: The number of social rewards that Bobby receives.
  - __The Genius__: The number of mental rewards that Bobby receives.
  - __The Student__: The total number checks that Bobby failed.

In addition to individual scores, the Aspects are also scored on their performance as a group during the game. The group score is the minimum of the individual scores.
