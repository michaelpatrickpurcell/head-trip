# Actual Play Example

## Act 1: Bobby's Bedroom
__GM__: Bobby's alarm goes off to a radio station set to loud rock music. Bobby opens his eyes. He is in his bedroom.

_The GM is introduces the setting and presents a mild stressor for the Pilot and Body to deal with._

__Pilot__: Body, turn off the alarm.

__Body__: Done.

_The Pilot wants to deal with the stressor introduced by the GM. So far, the situation isn't very stressful and the Pilot is easily able to get the Body to cooperate._

__Pilot__: Can I get a status report?

__Body__: Logic circuits working at full capacity. Free association and creativity banks fully charged. Heart pumping.  Stress levels are a still a bit elevated from that rude awakening. Fuel reserves are low, how about some breakfast?

_The Pilot doesn't have direct access to the mechanical description of how Bobby is doing at any given time in the game. While the Body does have direct access to this information, the Body can only discuss how Bobby is doing in fairly vague narrative terms rather than in explicit mechanical terms._

__GM__: Bobby's mom knocks on the the door. She yells "Bobby, aren't you up yet? The bus'll be here any second."

_The GM introduces another stressor and prompts the Pilot and the Body to get moving._

__Pilot__: OK, time to go. Let's move!

__Body__: Not so fast. We've got some basic maintenance to perform here. Bladder is reading at 9.9. We're going to need to do something about that.

__Pilot__: No time, it'll have to wait until we get to school.

_Things are getting a bit more stressful here.  The Pilot tries to respond to the stressor introduced by the GM but the Body objects. The Pilot is able to convince the body to cooperate, but at the cost of increased stress going forward._

__GM__: A horn honks outside. Bobby's sister says "Hey smarty-pants, the bus is here".

_The GM ratchets up the tension another notch by introducing an additional stressor._

__Pilot__: Let's go.

__Body__: What about breakfast?

_The Pilot attempts to respond to the GM's most recent stressor, but the Body still wants to try to address the stress that has already accumulated._

__GM__: Bobby's mom has laid out a nice breakfast on the kitchen table.  It's gotten a bit cold, but it still smells delicious.

_The GM presents the Pilot and Body with a choice. Spend some time to eat breakfast, which would guarantee that Bobby will be late for school, or skip breakfast, which would guarantee that Bobby will be hungry until he gets a chance to eat later in the day._

__Pilot__: We'll grab something on the way out.

_The Pilot decides that both choices are unappealing and instead challenges the GM to raise the stakes._

__GM__: Bobby gets outside just in time to see the bus disappear around the corner. This is the third time this month that he's missed the bus. If he's late for school, he's going to get detention.

_The GM accepts the challenge and raises the stakes by introducing a new stressor._

__Pilot__: Run for it!

__Body__: I can see you're going to put us all under a bit of a strain today. Initiating fight-or-flight response.

_The Pilot and Body work together to try to get to school on foot as fast as possible._

__GM__: Bobby gets to school with mere seconds to spare.  He slides into his seat just before the final bell rings.

_The Pilot and the Body succeed. They manage to deal with the stressors that the GM introduced throughout Act 1 and get Bobby to school both on time and well fed. The GM brings the scene to a close._

## Act 2: Chemistry Class

__GM__: Bobby's  first class today is chemistry. It looks like the lesson plan calls for some laboratory work with a partner. After taking the roll, the teacher says "OK my little ... monsters, let's create".  Bobby's partner turns to him and says "Um, I'm new here. My name's Annie. What's yours?"

__Body__: Heart reporting, captain. We just skipped a beat. She's beautiful!

__Pilot__: Let's introduce ourself. Bobby says, "Hi Annie, I'm beautiful. I mean, uh, I'm Bobby".

__GM__: Annie smiles and says "OK Bobby. I'll measure, you mix".

__Pilot__: Be careful everyone, this could be dangerous.

__Body__: She's dreamy. What if ...

__GM__: Suddenly, Annie shouts, "Bobby, watch out! It's on fire!"

__Body__: Initiating fight-or-flight response. Again.

__Pilot__: Whoa! Hands, get outta there! Feet! Stomp it! Stomp it! Put it out!

__GM__: Bobby manages to smother the fire. The other students giggle a bit, but quickly turn their attention back to their own work.

__Body__: Sorry sir, we got distracted there for a minute.  All system are still fully operational. No harm done. Say, now that everything is under control, any chance we might be able to find something to eat?  We never did get that breakfast.

__Pilot__: It will have to wait until lunchtime. We've still got a few more classes between now and then.

## Act 3: The Cafeteria

__GM__: Bobby makes it through the rest of the morning without incident. He finds himself in the cafeteria line behind Annie. She sees Bobby, smiles, and says, "Oh, hi!"

__Body__: Wow ...

__Pilot__: Let's keep it under control here. It didn't go so well last time we started daydreaming.

__GM__: Two boys walk up to Annie. The first says "Hey look, Chad, it's the new girl". Chad replies by saying "She needs some company, hey Rico?" The two boys start messing with the food on Annie's tray.

__Pilot__: We've got to do something! Let's stay calm and try to appeal to their better nature. Bobby says "Ahem! Come now, gentlemen. I'm sure I needn't point out the negative impact in both social and academic dimensions of your Neanderthal tactics".

__GM__: Chad and Rico turn their attention to Bobby and loom menacingly over him.

__Pilot__: Bobby keeps trying to talk them down. He says "I should point out that this will reflect very poorly on your citizenship record, and it'll look bad when you're not studying at the college of your choice".

__GM__: The boys pick Bobby up and throw him into a trash can.

__Body__: That's it, this means war. Ramming speed!

__GM__: The situation in the cafeteria quickly devolves into a full-on food fight.

__Pilot__: It like a shame for all of this food to go to waste. Let's grab a burger or something while we're here.

__GM__: Before long, a teacher breaks up the fight and identifies Bobby, Chad, and Rico as the instigators. She says "Perhaps a trip to the Principal's office will straighten you out".

__Pilot__: Oh no.

__Body__: We're gonna get the salt mines, I tell ya! The curtain! The big house! Maybe even prison!

__GM__: The teacher leads Chad and Rico into the principal's office and tells Bobby to wait outside.  The principal eventually tells Chad and Rico that they will have detention for the next six weeks. Then it's Bobby's turn. The principal asks Bobby "What's your side of the story?"

__Body__: We're hyperventilating! I don't know how much more of this we can take.  

__Pilot__: Everybody, just relax! This isn't the end of the world, okay? If we work together, we can figure something out.

__Body__: We'll try, but we're still pretty worked up here. It isn't fair that we're in here when all we were trying to do was protect Annie.

__Pilot__: Good point!  Maybe, if we just explain why we did what we did, the principal might let us off easy.  Bobby says "I'm sorry, Mr. Hardcase. When I saw those guys bugging Annie, I - I guess I just lost my head".

__GM__: The principal tries to suppress a smile and says "I think we can be a little lenient here. Why don't you just help the janitor clean up the cafeteria after school?"

__Pilot__: OK, it looks like we dodged a bullet there.  Lunchtime will be over soon and we need to get to class.

## Act 4: Hallway

__GM__: On the way to class, Bobby runs into Annie in the hall.  She says "Look, um, I just wanted to thank you for helping me out with those guys who were hassling me".

__Body__: She likes us!  Woohoo! What if ...

__Pilot__: Not this again, this is our chance to do something constructive. We're going to ask her out.

__Body__: We're feeling pretty wobbly all of a sudden, but we'll hold it together.  Go for it!

__Pilot__: Here goes nothing. Bobby says, "Maybe we could go out sometime after school, like maybe to the mall or something?"

__GM__: Annie looks a bit taken aback and shuffles her feet for a second or two. Then, she smiles and says, "Okay. That'd be great! Thanks again, Bobby". She kisses Bobby on the cheek and walks away down the hall with a spring in her step.
